"""Shed

    You walk over to the shed. The door seems to be locked, or 
at least stuck. You ram the door. It seems to be working, so you 
ram it again. The lock breaks, and you tumble into the shed. Where 
the floor should be is a deep hole in the ground. You try to
grab the door to save yourself, but you miss. You fall down the hole
to your grisly death.
