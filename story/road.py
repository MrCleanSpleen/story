"""Road

    You keep walking down the road until you get to a forest. It is now very late at night. You are
very tired, and decide to go to sleep under a tree. You wake up, and there is a man holding a spear
in front of you. He has turned his back to you, and it looks like he is making sure you don't 
escape. You could fight him, or you could talk to him. Hopefuly he knows english, or whichever
language you are fluent in.
