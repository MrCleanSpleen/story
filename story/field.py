    You awake in a grassy field with no idea of how you got there. In fact,
you don't even know who you are. You see a road. You decide to walk down the road,
knowing that a road may lead to civilization.

    After a while, the sun is starting to set. There is a blue shed a few hundred 
meters off the road, and you could spend the night in it.
