"""Revive

    You wake up at the bottom of the deep hole. It seems as if you have died and 
come back to life, but you don't know if it will happen again. You don't want to risk 
it. The walls have torches placed on them at regular intervals. It looks like there
is a bend in the tunnel, and you canÂ´t see what is down it. Your gut tells you to go 
up the ladder to go back to the surface, but you are curious to see what is down the tunnel.
